# User-Complaint-Management-System-Using-PHP
**User Complaint Management System**

This project is a web application designed to facilitate the efficient management of user complaints. Built using PHP and HTML, it provides a seamless interface for users to report their complaints while ensuring robust security measures against hacking attempts such as SQL injection.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Complaint Reporting:** Users can easily report their complaints through a user-friendly web interface. The system collects relevant details such as the nature of the complaint, contact information, and any supporting documents.

2. **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators have full access to the system through a dedicated dashboard. They can view all complaints, categorize them, assign priorities, and manage their resolution process.

3. **Complaint Tracking:** The system enables tracking of complaints from submission to resolution. Administrators can update the status of complaints, add comments, and communicate with users regarding the progress.

4. **Secure Authentication:** Robust authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only authorized users, both administrators and regular users, can access the system. This helps prevent unauthorized access and protects sensitive complaint data.

5. **Protection Against SQL Injection:** The system is fortified against SQL injection attacks, a common vulnerability in web applications. By utilizing prepared statements, input validation, and other security best practices, the integrity of the database is safeguarded.

6. **Customizable and Scalable:** The project is designed to be highly customizable and scalable, allowing for easy integration of additional features or modifications to suit specific organizational needs.

**Technologies Used:**

- PHP: Backend scripting language for server-side processing and logic.
- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages.
- CSS: Styling language for enhancing the visual presentation of the web application.
- MySQL: Database management system for storing and managing complaint data securely.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Configure the database connection settings in the appropriate configuration file.
3. Set up the necessary tables and schema in the MySQL database.
4. Deploy the application on a web server that supports PHP.
5. Access the application through a web browser and start managing complaints.
